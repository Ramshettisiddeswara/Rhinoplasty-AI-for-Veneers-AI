# Rhinoplasty AI for Veneers AI

## Project Overview

The **Rhinoplasty AI** aims to help individuals explore potential changes to their facial features, specifically the nose, by using advanced AI-powered tools. The primary objective of this project is to build an AI system that allows users to visualize what they would look like with a different nose shape or size.

Inspired by the personal story of considering a nose transformation, this AI will provide users with realistic, dynamic visualizations of their face with different rhinoplasty alterations. Whether it's for cosmetic purposes or to help users make an informed decision, this technology brings them one step closer to self-expression and confidence.

## Key Features
- **Face Detection**: Identifies key features of the face, specifically the nose.
- **Nose Alteration**: Offers a variety of nose shape options, sizes, and angles.
- **360Â° View**: Users can see their new nose from multiple angles.
- **User Demo**: Upload a photo and get instant rhinoplasty visualizations.
  
## Technologies Used
- **AI Models**: MidJourney, Flux, or similar for image generation and modifications.
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: AWS, Google Cloud for hosting and AI model training.
- **Web Technologies**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript for creating the front-end UI.
- **Image Processing**: OpenCV and TensorFlow for face detection and image processing.

## How to Run the Project Locally

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rhinoplasty-ai.git
    cd rhinoplasty-ai
    ```

2. Install required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. To run the app locally:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

4. Upload a photo and get rhinoplasty simulations.

## Running the AI Model

The AI model is built using pre-trained neural networks that help modify nose shapes in the uploaded images. The core steps include:
1. **Face Detection**: Using OpenCV and Dlib to detect the face and its features.
2. **Nose Modification**: AI models like MidJourney or Flux can generate multiple nose shapes and sizes based on the detected face.
3. **Real-Time Rendering**: The system provides real-time modifications and allows the user to rotate and view their new nose.
